Upgrading instructions
======================

This file contains instructions for upgrading your Flow 2.2 based
applications to TYPO3 Flow 2.3.

Upgrading your Packages
-----------------------

Upgrading existing code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here comes the easier part. As with earlier changes to TYPO3 Flow that
required code changes on the user side we provide a code migration tool.
Given you have a TYPO3 Flow system with your (outdated) package in place
you should run the following before attempting to fix anything by hand::

 ./flow core:migrate --package-key Acme.Demo

The package key is optional, if left out it will work on all packages
it finds - for the first run you might want to limit things a little to
keep the overview, though.

Inside core:migrate
"""""""""""""""""""

The tool roughly works like this:

* Collect all code migrations from packages

* Collect all files from all packages (except *Framework* and
  *Libraries*) or the package given with ``--package-key``
* For each migration and package

  * Check for clean git working copy (otherwise skip it)
  * Check if migration is needed (looks for Migration footers in commit
    messages)
  * Apply migration and commit the changes

Afterwards you probably get a list of warnings and notes from the
migrations, check those to see if anything needs to be done manually.

Check the created commits and feel free to amend as needed, should
things be missing or wrong. The only thing you must keep in place from
the generated commit messages is the Migration: … footer. It is used to
detect if a migration has been applied already, so if you drop it,
things might get out of hands in the future.

Upgrading the database schema
-----------------------------

Upgrading the schema is done by running::

 ./flow doctrine:migrate

to update your database with any changes to the framework-supplied
schema.

Famous last words
-----------------

In a nutshell, running::

 ./flow core:migrate
 ./flow doctrine:migrationgenerate

padded with some manual checking and adjustments needs to be done. That
should result in a working package.

If it does not and you have no idea what to do next, please come over
to `#typo3-flow <irc://freenode.net/#typo3-flow>`_ on freenode IRC or
ask in the mailing list (news group) as you prefer. The `support page
<http://flow.typo3.org/support.html>`_ provides more information.
