TYPO3 Flow 2.3
--------------

Welcome to TYPO3 Flow!

There are a few things you need to know to get started with TYPO3 Flow.
All necessary steps are explained in the Getting Started tutorial which
you find on http://docs.typo3.org/flow/TYPO3FlowDocumentation/Quickstart/Index.html

In short here's what you need to do:

1) Set up a virtual host for your web server and let it point to the Web/
   directory of TYPO3 Flow.
2) Adjust the file permissions. On Linux / Mac just run
   sudo ./flow flow:core:setfilepermissions johndoe wwwuser wwwgroup
   from TYPO3 Flow's main directory (replace the user names by some matching
   your system environment!).
3) Call the URL leading to your virtual host from a browser

Have fun!
